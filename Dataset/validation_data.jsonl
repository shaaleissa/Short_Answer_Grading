This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in \"a + b\").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written \"+ a b\".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written \"a b +\".  (You may have seen this as \"reverse Polish notation\".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.  One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations.<br>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is graded as 5.0."}]}
